      Here comes a wave meant to wash me away A tide that is taking me under
      Swallowing sand left with nothing to say My voice drowned out in the
      thunder But I won't cry And I won't start to crumble Whenever they try To
      shut me or cut me down I won't be silenced You can't keep me quiet Won't
      tremble when you try it All I know is I won't go speechless 'Cause I'll
      breathe When they try to suffocate me Don't you underestimate me 'Cause I
      know that I won't go speechless Written in stone Every rule every word
      Centuries old and unbending Stay in your place Better seen and not heard
      But now that story is ending 'Cause I I cannot start to crumble So come on
      and try Try to shut me and cut me down I won't be silenced You can't keep
      me quiet Won't tremble when you try it All I know is I won't go speechless
      speechless Let the storm in I cannot be broken No I won't live unspoken
      'Cause I know that I won't go speechless Try to lock me in this cage I
      won't just lay me down and die I will take these broken wings And watch me
      burn across the sky Hear the echo saying I won't be silenced Though you
      wanna see me tremble When you try it All I know is I won't go speechless
      speechless 'Cause I'll breathe When they try to suffocate me Don't you
      underestimate me 'Cause I know that I won't go speechless All I know is I
      won't go speechless speechless
